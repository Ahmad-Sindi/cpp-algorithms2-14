Algorithm Challenge #14 – Inverted Letter Pattern
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive integer from the user and prints an inverted letter pattern using uppercase ASCII letters.

The program maps numbers to letters using ASCII values, starting from 'A' + (Number - 1) and decreasing the letter each row while also reducing its repetition count.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
How ASCII character mapping works

How to convert numeric ASCII codes to characters

How nested loops operate in pattern generation

Validating user input

Writing clean and modular C++ code

Strengthening logic and foundational algorithmic skills

🧩 Example
-
Input:

Enter a positive number: 4

Output:

DDDD

CCC

BB

A
